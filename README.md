# Habit-Tracker
Machine Coding Round Two


Features#
Add a habit:

Create a "+" icon or a "Add a new habit" button on the habit listing/ landing page which will open a dialog box kind of component with different text boxes for the details of the habit.
These text boxes will ask for the details, like the Name of the habit, the Goal of the habits, How many times do you want to perform the habit & what would be the start date.

Each habit view

If user clicks on any particular habit, all details of that habit should be visible.

Edit/Delete/Archive a habit

Edit:
I can see an "edit" option to edit the details of the habit that were entered earlier.
Delete:
I can see a "trash" icon or "delete" button to delete the habits.
Archive:
I can see an archive button that would archive a habit and that habit would show up on the archive page and get removed from the landing page.
